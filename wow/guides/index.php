This is a quick guide to get the level 100 follower <a>Image of Archmage Vargoth</a>.

There are four items that the temporally displaced archmage has deposited in time, scattered across Draenor, generally in level 100 areas.

They will show a quest available on the minimap, so are easy enough to find when you are close, a magically image of the mage will appear above the item before you come up to it close.

Their locations are:

<img title='Mysterious Boots'>
<img title='Mysterious Hat'>
<img title='Mysterious Staff'>

These are all to be returned to the gnome Zooti Fizzlefury at the Archmage's tower.

After he performs a ritual, the archmage will appear and offer you his services.
