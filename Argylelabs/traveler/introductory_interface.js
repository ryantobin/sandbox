// Connection from you

// radial graph that emits outwards over time

// degrees and frequecy of contact determine you're inner circle

// as well as the degree to which the connection

// fades over time

// but it never disappears

// it remains on the edge

// melted in until by chance

// or mouseover

// you see them again

// and maybe it tells you something

// but that's your life

// in one dimension

// there is also another

// space and time

// space -- the places you've been

// there is a way to travel through it

// there are a number of ways

// infinite is bigger than any one or any thing can count

// time -- looking over a map -- looking from the outside

// to some body, some day

// flip through time

// ping on map

// burst, then glow

///TODO: That's just the interface
