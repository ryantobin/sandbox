<b>The EMI Group and how we store data about you</b><br /><br />

In order to communicate with you about local events, offers and opportunities and other news, the data that we collect from you may be transferred to, stored and processed by the EMI Group of Companies or one of our suppliers based in Europe, North America, South East Asia, Asia Pacific or Latin America. Such entities may be engaged in, among other things: preparing and sending newsletters to which you subscribe; the fulfilment of your orders; the processing of payment details; and the provision of support services. The laws of some countries may not provide the same levels of protection of personal data as your home country, particularly if you are resident in the EEA. By submitting data, you agree to the collection, transfer, storage or processing of data about you for the purposes described in this policy.  We will take reasonable steps to ensure that data about you is treated securely in accordance with this policy, and that all information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or those of our service providers. 

<br /><br />
<b>Passwords</b>
<br /><br />
Where we have given you (or you have chosen) a password to access the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.  Please do not share the password with anyone.
<br /><br />

<b>How we use Personal Data about you</b>
<br /><br />
All the information we collect via our Website, or through correspondence with you, is used to provide you with any information, products or services you have requested, to operate the EMI Group's business and to improve the services and products that we offer you.  We will use personal data about you for purposes such as:

<ul>
<li>managing the Website and access to it so that it is presented in the most effective way for you and your computer; </li>
<li>dealing with orders and accounts for the supply of our goods and services; </li>
<li>planning and managing EMI's business activities, including analysing users' preferences; </li>
<li>research; </li>
<li>providing you with information about the products and services we offer (subject to your preferences where possible); </li>
<li>providing you with information about specially selected third-party products and services (if you consent to receive such information on registration), and </li>
<li>notifying you of any changes to our products and services. </li>
</ul>

<br />As described above data may be shared within the EMI Group of Companies. There are only a limited number of circumstances where we may share with others some or all of the data about you that we hold; these are set out below.
<br />
<ul>
<li>With local agents and such other third parties who assist us in the services we provide to you by, for example, hosting sites, or sending emails on our behalf and with retail partners on the Website.  In these instances, we provide them with only the information that they will need to perform their function. </li>
<li>In the event that our business assets are ever sold to, or purchased by, another company (our data records are part of our business). </li>
<li>With our joint venture partners. </li>
<li>Except in respect of registrations via www.abbeyroadplugins.com, we may share personal data about you with our artists and their representatives.  Such artists may use this information to contact you regarding products, programs, services and promotions that the artists believe may be of interest to you.  We do not control, and are not responsible for, artists' use of personal data.  If you decide that you no longer wish EMI to be able to share personal data with artists and their representatives, please see the section on opting-out below. </li>
<li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share personal data about you in order to comply with any legal obligation at the request of public authorities, or in order to enforce or apply our <a href="http://www.emi.com/page/emi/TermsAndConditions" target="emi-terms">Terms and Conditions</a> to protect the rights, property or safety of EMI, our customers, or others. </li>
<li>We may make available services such as message boards, chat functionality and blogs, among other services to which you are able to post information and materials. Please note that any information you disclose through such services or otherwise on the Website becomes public information, and may be available to visitors to the Website and to the general public. In addition, when you choose to make a posting on such services, certain personal data, will be available for other users to view. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose personal data about you, or any other information, on the Website. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF ANY PERSONAL DATA YOU VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THROUGH THE WEBSITE. </li>
<li>With your express consent. </li>
</ul>

So far as practicable we will seek to ensure that each disclosure will be subject to an obligation of confidentiality. <br /><br />

We may also share anonymised, aggregated data, such as access statistics, with third parties such as advertisers. This will not involve the identification of individuals.
<br /><br />

<b>How we communicate with you and how you can opt-out from receiving future communications or from our sharing personal data about you </b>
<br /><br />
We may use the information we collect to contact you by post, email and telephone (including automated calls, by SMS text messages and other multimedia electronic messages such as picture messaging) so as to communicate information to you about products, services, offers and other news.
<br /><br />
We will not send you unsolicited premium rate sms messages (which are sms messages you pay to receive), although your service provider may impose a charge on messages that you receive. Please check with your service provider for details. You will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such marketing information at the point when your details are collected. All promotional information from us will come with instructions on how to opt-out from receiving further information in the future.

We will endeavour to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to remove personal data about you from the databases of joint venture partners or any artists with which we have already shared personal data about you (i.e., to which we have already provided personal data about you as of the date that we implement your opt-out request).If you wish to cease receiving marketing-related e-mails from such joint venture partners or any artists, please contact such joint venture partners or any artists directly or utilize any opt-out mechanisms set forth in their respective privacy policies or marketing-related e-mails.
<br /><br />
<b>Data over the Internet and other websites</b>
<br /><br />
